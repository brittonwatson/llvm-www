      <dt><b>Quick Talks</b></dt>
      <dd>Quick 10 minute talks that dive a bit deeper into a topic, but not as deep as a Technical Talk.</dd>

      <dt><b>Student Technical Talks</b></dt>
      <dd>Graduate or Undergraduate students present their work using LLVM.</dd>

      <dt><b>Panels</b></dt>

    <h3>Guide to Writing a proposal for the LLVM Developers' Meeting</h3>
    <p>This is a guide to help you submit the best proposal and increase your chances of your proposal being accepted. The LLVM Developers' Meeting program committee receives more proposals than can be accepted, so please read this guide carefully.</p>
    <p>If you have never presented at an LLVM Developers' Meeting, then do not fear this process. We are actively looking for new speakers who are excited about LLVM and helping grow the community through these educational talks! You do not need to be a long time developer to submit a proposal.</p>

    <h4>General Guidelines:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>In your abstract, clearly state what your topic is, who your targeted audience is, and what takeaways attendees should expect.</li>
      <li>Talks about a use of LLVM (etc) should include details about how LLVM is used and not only be about the resulting application.</li>
      <li>Talks about how to use X in LLVM (or other subproject) are greatly desired and beneficial to many developers.</li>
      <li>Entry level topics are encouraged as well.</li>
      <li>Tutorials on "how to use X" in LLVM (or other subproject) are greatly desired and beneficial to many developers. Entry level topics are encouraged as well.</li>
      <li>The program committee gets a lot of proposals and does not have time to read 10 page papers for each submission.</li>
      <li><i>Talks that have been presented at other technical conferences tend to not get accepted. If you have presented this topic before, make it clear what is new and different in your talk.</i></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Guide to Proposal Fields:</h4>
    
    <p><b>Title:</b></p>
    <p>This will be displayed on the website, schedule, and signs. Keep it short and catchy to attract attendees to your talks. A couple of examples are "WebAssembly: Here Be Dragons" or "Beyond Sanitizers: guided fuzzing and security hardening".</p>

    <p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
    <p>Here you can include details about your talk. An outline, demo description, what takeaways will your audience have, etc. 1-2 paragraphs is sufficient usually.</p>
    <p>This section will not be published and is intended for the program committee to better understand how interesting your talk will be to the audience. For example, if you would prefer not to reveal some conclusions in the published abstract, explaining them here ensures that the PC can take them into account when evaluating your proposal.</p>

    <p><b>Submission:</b></p>
    <p>Optional PDF containing extended details. This is in addition to the abstract. Keep in mind that the program committee does not have time to read 10 page papers for each proposal.</p>

    <p><b>Authors:</b></p>
    <p>Anyone who is an author of the work or the proposal. We do blind submission, so the program committee will not see this information.</p>

    <p><b>Website Abstract:</b></p>
    <p>1 paragraph. This is displayed on the schedule and website for attendees to consider when selecting talks. We suggest you proof read and pay attention to grammar.</p>

    <p><b>What type of talk submission is this?</b></p>
    <p>Here you can select the type of talk you are proposing.</p>

    <p><b>For technical talks, are you open to a shorter length talk?</b></p>
    <p>This applies only to those proposing a technical talk (20 minutes). Often we have space for shorter talks (5 or 10 min), so please indicate if you are open to giving a shorter talk on this topic instead.</p>

    <p><b>Speaker Name(s), Photo, Bio (up to 5 for panels including the moderator):</b></p>
    <p>This should be only the people giving the talk. Typically this is 1 or 2 people for longer talks, and only 1 for shorter length. This is not shared with the program committee. It is used by the logistics team to populate the speaker page on the event site and get speakers registered. This is required information as it takes longer to add speaker information after the fact. For panels, please determine your panelists and moderator at the time of submission.</p>

    <p><b>Which speaker is your moderator? (PANELS ONLY, all others write N/A)</b></p>
    <p>List the moderator name. The program committee does not see this.</p>

    <p><b>PC conflicts</b></p>
    <p>Check any conflicts with program committee members. These are people that can not be impartial when reviewing your proposal. See HotCRP for the full definition of conflict.</p>
